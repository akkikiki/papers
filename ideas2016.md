Some initial ideas for my research topic.

# Curriculum Learning
* The advantage of learning "learning easier data first"

# NLP for short texts
* Text understanding on short texts requires more “context” somehow.
 * authors, time, replies, tweets nearby, sentiment, ...
 * In that sense, user embeddings (e.g., [User Embedding for Scholarly Microblog Recommendation, ACL 2016 (short paper)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2073.pdf)) is a very interesting direction of reasearch.
