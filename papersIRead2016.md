# Deep Learning
[Long Short-Term Meomory Neural Networks, EMNLP 2015](http://www.emnlp2015.org/proceedings/EMNLP/pdf/EMNLP141.pdf)
* Uses 3 NNs 1) character embeddings, 2) LSTM, and 3) tag inference.
* Takes 3 days to train on PKU dataset using CPU without any optimization.
* A code implemented by another person is [here](https://github.com/dalstonChen/CWS_LSTM) but I have not checked if this implementation is correct or not.
